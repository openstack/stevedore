    Entry point names are not unique and it is possible for many entry points
    to exist with the same name and namespace. This can be problematic where
    the name itself is relevant. To address this, a new ``conflict_resolver``
    parameter has been added to all extension managers. This is a callable that
    can be used to handle conflicts when retrieving entry points by name. This
    defaults to the current behavior of returning the last found entry point,
    though it will now log a warning.
