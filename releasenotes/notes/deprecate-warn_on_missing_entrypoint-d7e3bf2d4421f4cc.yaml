deprecations:
  - |
    The ``warn_on_missing_entrypoint`` parameter to ``NamedExtensionManager``,
    ``DriverManager``, and ``HookManager``, has been deprecated. Warnings were
    already enabled by default. To disable them, instead set
    ``on_load_failure_callback`` to ``None`` or provide a custom callback that
    does not log warnings.
